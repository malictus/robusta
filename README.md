Robusta
=======

Robusta is a set of Java and Swing utilities, useful for supplementing out of the box functionality in Java classes. Many Swing functions are included; check the documentation inside the source files for details. The only extra dependency needed besides core Java code is the JavaMail library available [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html).

Robusta was written in 2010 or so, so some functions may now be out of date. Added to Github in October 2014 for safekeeping.
