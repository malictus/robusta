Robusta
=======

Robusta is a set of Java and Swing utilities, useful for supplementing out of the box functionality in Java classes. Many Swing functions are included; check the documentation inside the source files for details.

Robusta was written in 2010 or so, so some functions may now be out of date. Added to Github in October 2014 for safekeeping.
